# Hello

My name is Simon Nyberg. I live in Stockholm with my wife and two sons.  

I am a seasoned software engineer with a strong focus on iOS development and extensive experience in Node.js. Currently, I am employed as a Principal iOS Engineer at Viaplay, where I specialize in developing and maintaining iOS applications. In addition to my technical responsibilities, I also mentor other engineers and serve as a guild lead for the iOS community.
